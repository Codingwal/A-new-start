TODO:

- Rivers
    - RiverGenerator generates points at chunk border
        - for example corners + 3 extra points per side as options
        - select by lowest height
    - MapDataGenerator generates the river from the start point to the end point (without the river leaving the chunk)
        - A* pathfinding with noise

- lake shader
- river shader


FUTURE PLANS:

- Add swimming

- Add stamina, health, hunger and thirst
- Add falldamage

- Improve world generation
    - Less visible triangles
    - Better balanced heights
    - Biomes
    - Improve water generation
    - Trees, grass and rocks
    - Better texturing
        - Choose texture depending on steepness, biome and height
        - Reduce texture stretching
